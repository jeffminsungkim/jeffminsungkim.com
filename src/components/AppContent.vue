        The purpose of creating this website is to share things that I'm interested in
        and also to describe how seriously I care about doing things on web development.
        Furthermore, I believe it's a wonderful opportunity for me to get my hands dirty to enhance my front-end skills.

      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>
        I've finally launched ðŸŽ‰ a super simple fanciest personal website in early 2018.
        This website built within less than a day, by using <a href="https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js">Nuxt.js</a> and other amazing tools.
        Now I'm going to share the story of how I ended up with building this website.

        <h2>How I get started</h2>
        <p>
          At the time of writing, usage of static websites is increasing in popularity.
          In fact, it's not a big surprise as static site generators seem to have been gaining more popular among web developers these days too.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, I had a chance to read one of the blog
          <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/">posts</a>
          on Netlify which was thankfully written by Eli Williamson.
          After finish reading his article thought it would be nice to get constructed with a static site
          before I dive into building my first website.
        </p>

        <h2>Static Site Generators</h2>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above, static site generators are one of the most popular options to create personal websites for developers.
          They've been around for a while, but have recently started gaining some serious steam.
        </p>
        <p>
          First thing first, I had to pick one of the
          <a href="https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators">static site generators</a> to make the magic happen on my website.
          <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> holds itâ€™s position at #1 as the most popular static site generator, but I wasn't really into it.
          Meanwhile, two frameworks called
          <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a> and
          <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt.js</a> draw my attention while reading the post that I mentioned a minute ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator for React.
          I've been seeing a lot of people talking about Gatsby on Twitter, and everyone seems to love it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> Applications.
          Its main scope is <strong>UI rendering</strong> while abstracting away the client/server distribution.
          Also, the Nuxt offers server rendering or static file rendering to boost the performance of your web application.

        <p>
          As you may have noticed it seems like they both provide Server-Side Rendering feature!
          So before moving on, let's briefly talk about what the server-side rendering is, and let's find out the real benefit.
        </p>
        <div class="line-breaker">
          <h2>What is Server Side Rendering?</h2>
          <p>
            Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of taking a client-side JavaScript framework website and
            rendering it to static HTML and CSS on the server.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
          <p>Most designers and developers tend to focus on building better aesthetic design or adding new nifty functionality on web pages.</p>
          <p>People, however, want fast-loading websites, and server-side rendering is a tool to help you get your site rendered faster!</p>
          <em>Be aware that page loading time is a critical factor in any website's user experience and moreover when it comes to search engine rankings.</em>

        <h2>Why Nuxt.js?</h2>
        <p>
          I was wavering between two frameworks Gatsby and Nuxt.
